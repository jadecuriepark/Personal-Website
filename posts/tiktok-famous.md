*The following narrative was an essay I wrote for an award!*

When my chubby 10-year old fingers clasped my first iPad, it was love at first touch. Visions of social media stardom clouded my imagination as I uploaded singing videos with it onto Musical.ly. The filters I put were probably too saturated, and the sound was somehow crunchy, but I was eager to share my passions with the rest of the world. Eventually, social media creation rekindled in quarantine: an Instagram account in 7th-grade and a TikTok account initiated in 8th.

As those two accounts started amassing thousands of followers, what endeared me the most weren't the likes I gained - it was the comments that flowed in numerous languages expressing their support. Thanks to technology, I witnessed the interconnectivity of people around the globe right in front of me. So why couldn't I also take a step forward to create a global impact that brings people together?

Okay. I admit that goal was far fetched, but it was just the push I needed to begin my programming journey. Navigating the world of code alone was daunting initially, and I was a bit disappointed that I didn't hack into a government firewall my first day. However, starting small and learning how to program in HTML & CSS helped me progress into more languages and opportunities, such as Capture the flag competitions (I'm going to hack into a firewall someday.)

I may be the only person in history that found their passion for computing through Musical.ly videos. But as a programmer, it's our job to be the first in a lot of things.
