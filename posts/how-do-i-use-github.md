title: 'How do I even use Github?'

I went to my first hackathon a week ago and had an outrageously amazing time. Yes, it was outrageous how amazing it was. It was even a time of many firsts: first time chugging three consecutive bottles of jasmine green tea, first time coding a dating app, and first time meeting someone from Kentucky! I’ve made so many wonderful experiences with wonderful people, but meeting so many coders made me reflect on own skills. Sure, I’ve been coding for the past couple years (if coding cringy HTML websites that guessed your favorite Broadway musical counted) but I didn’t think I had any sort of platform to show for it. So after I got home and unpacked my bags, I decided to make a GitHub account that displayed all of my projects. This way, I could **totally** be automatically upgraded to coding genius.

*My 100% real reaction to my genius plan*

Okay, okay. I kinda lied. I already had a GitHub account, but hear me out! My GitHub, a place that should have been bursting with huge projects and hundreds of repositories, was butt-naked. I barely even KNEW what a repository was, and while other developers had entire skyscrapers in their 3D contribution skyline, mine looked flatter than the Midwest. I just wanted to clean up my current account so it looked like I at least had more coding experience than a fetus. Simple, right? Wrong. Who knew uploading everything you’ve coded in the past five years could be so tedious? I was rethinking my master plan.

So, present day. I'll cut most of the gobbledygook to you and say that in the end, I never figured out how to use GitHub. I just want to continue creating new things, and that by itself is more than okay! For now, I’ll just appreciate other people’s 500-file repositories and accept my naked GitHub for what it is. And hopefully meet more people from Kentucky.

**UPDATE 09/25/2022:** Through learning how to code this very website you're reading, I finally *kinda* figured out GitHub. Well, just enough so I can store my edits on the website. My skyscraper is still naked-looking.
