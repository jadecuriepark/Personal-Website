title: 'Q1 Sophomore Year Class Review'

Okay, fine. I lied. I haven't finished my first quarter of sophomore year yet, but I'm almost halfway there, so I feel obligated to write this review on how my classes are going so far. I guess this post is also a chance for me to get my mess of a mind together because OH LORD: if a class could deep fry your brain, AP Chemistry would be that class.

For some context, the classes I'm taking this year are much more rigorous than last years' (which should honestly not be a surprise to anyone because a year ago, I was a puny freshman) but harder classes exist! I'm probably being a liiiitle dramatic. But just a little.

- Firstly, I have **French IV**. This class is like an oasis in the Sahara desert of high school. My teacher has such wonderful vibes, and the class is relaxed enough that I don't feel like my existence is melting the entire 90-minute block. Foreign Language classes at my school also have ZERO homework, so WOOHOO! Je suis trés heureuse!

- Second period every day, I have **AP Chemistry**. You know what? I'll save this class for the end. It deserves its own little section!

- I have **AP English Language** after Chemistry, and it's a very chill class so far. I LOVE how my teacher was a theater major, and as a theater kid, I feel intrinsically connected to her amplified gestures, beautiful voice projection, and snazzy fashion. I don't consider myself extremely pulled to reading and rhetorical analysis, but I love the variety of authors I'm exposed to in the class. Oh, and upperclassmen are chill.

- **Gym** is gym. Getting all sweaty and burning  calories! Yay! I do love watching the handball matches though: my classmates get extremely competitive.

- **AP US History** was a class that I signed up on a whim, and I was NOT expecting myself to like it as much as I do! My teacher explains everything really well, and I especially loved my old table mates. They were so funny and made me look forward to every APUSH block :)

- **Precalculus** is alright. I think I could definitely put in some more effort into the class considering how fundemental the concepts are for the future, but it's sometimes difficult to give math your 100% when it's the last period of the day... At least my teacher is super kind and my tablemates are great to vibe with.

- Oh boy. It's time for **AP Chemistry (real)**. Honestly, I think I'm at fault for having some questionable study habits (ok, I procrastinate a lot) but NO ONE could have prepared me for the workload the class is. From a student who's never taken a single Chemistry class in their life, this was an exponential leap that I have to look in the mirror everyday to convince myself again why I took the class. Sure, my teacher is wonderful and my classmates are there to share my woes, but WOW. Just wow. I really hope I'll survive to see the end of the school year.

Wish me luck :)
