title: 'How do I even use Github?'

I went to my first hackathon a week ago and had an outrageously amazing time. Yes, it was outrageous how amazing it was. It was a time of many firsts: first time chugging three consecutive bottles of jasmine green tea, first time coding a dating app, and first time actually meeting someone from Kentucky! I’ve made so many wonderful experiences with wonderful people, but meeting so many coders made me reflect on own skills. Sure, I’ve been coding for the past couple years (if cringe-inducing HTML websites that guessed your favorite Broadway musical count) but I didn’t think I had any sort of platform to show for it. So after I got home and unpacked my bags, I decided to make a GitHub account that displayed all of my code. This way, I could **totally** be automatically upgraded to coding genius.

*My 100% real reaction to my genius plan*

Okay, okay. I lied. I already have a GitHub account, but hear me out! My GitHub, a place that should be bursting with past projects and code, is butt-naked. I barely know what a repository is, and while other developers have entire skyscrapers in their 3D contribution skyline, mine looks flatter than the Midwest. I just wanted to clean up my current account so it looked like I actually coded something. Simple, right? Wrong. Who knew uploading everything you’ve coded in the past five years could be so tedious? Was this even necessary?
I’ll cut most of the gobbledygook to you and tell you that in the end, I never figured out how to use GitHub. I want to continue creating new things, and that’s okay! For now, I’ll just appreciate other people’s 500-file repositories and accept my naked GitHub for what it is. And hopefully meet more people from Kentucky.
I think that sounds like a good plan.
